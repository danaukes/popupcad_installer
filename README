> Find the hooks.py file in cx_freeze folder. Change line 548 from finder.IncludePackage("scipy.lib") to finder.IncludePackage("scipy._lib").

### Shapely workaround
When you try to freeze shapely, an exception is thrown because this particular piece of code doesnt' work when frozen. I've tested this on a windows machine in both the frozen and unfrozen versions, and it seems to work.

shapely/geos.py, line 134
-        wininst_dlls = os.path.abspath(os.__file__ + "../../../DLLs")
+        wininst_dlls = os.path.normpath(os.path.abspath(sys.executable+'../../DLLS'))

### EZDXF
currently 0.7.4 does not work, revert to 0.7.0
